# Sisyphus :  A Fog of Serverless Functions

**Sisyphus is an Experimental Proof of Concept Research from 2011-2013**

Sisyphus is an actor based programming model, in which functions are sent across a network for execution. This approach was developed between 2011-2013 by Chris Woods who was a researcher at Intel Labs Europe. The work is published and introduced to readers here. This post explains the motivations which prompted the creation of Sisyphus. It highlights the many advantages the approach provides, before providing an open source working example, and outlining the recommended steps to take Sisyphus from concept to a working production implementation. 

The documentation and some of the example application code are still being updated. But the important thing about Sisyphus was it demonstrated an Actor-Based FaaS model which maps well to FaaS.

You can details on the design of Sisyphus in the [Documentation folder](https://github.com/woodsmc/sisyphus/blob/master/Documentation/Creating%20a%20Fog%20of%20Serverless%20Functions%20in%202011.md)
